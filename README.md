# Clone Starbucks.com 

I have tried to clone Starbucks.com with only frontend part. Unfortunately, i could not make it reponsively. 

Live demo is available from https://ideveloperbrandon.github.io/Starbucks-clone/

One thing i clearly learnt is Grid/Flexbox. I mean there's so many CSS properties and still need to apply for responsive web design to make it works on any devices. 

I really enjoyed cloning this and tested my CSS skills. This experience will be my asset one day.
